# Training Technologies with basic app

A repository for testing multiples features by creating a todo-list app in multiple frameworks in multiple ways

I use pocketbase as a database server and api endpoint, see `./pocketbase`

# How To Test

- Navigate to `pocketbase`, open console and do `./pocketbase serve`
- Navigate to any of the framework you want and run them (eg : `npm start` for React)

**I don't consider myself an expert in any of these technologies. Assume that the code is not a good reference.**

For the moment we have
### Web
- React
- Vue
- Angular

### Web serverside
- Nextjs

### Mobile
- React Native
